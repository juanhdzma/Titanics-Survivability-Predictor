The classification task will involve a binary variable, where '1' indicates that the passenger survived and '0' indicates that the passenger did not survive.\n\nTo gain a better understanding of the problem, we will now proceed with a brief overview of the dataset and its values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","metadata":{"id":"SEo1wvN6vWbL"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Dataset and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)","metadata":{"id":"U979gvEMvR-T"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\n\ndataset = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/titanic/train.csv')\ndataset.head()","metadata":{"id":"cn3uJJMjitQj","outputId":"4a753f93-64e7-40ad-844f-b7a30553d904","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-05-14T20:06:39.19479Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-05-14T20:06:39.195151Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-05-14T20:06:39.27378Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-05-14T20:06:39.195121Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-05-14T20:06:39.272516Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### *Metadata*\nMeaning and possible values of each attribute:\n\n**PassengerId**: Index of passangers (Positive integer)\n\n**Survived**: State of the passanger (1, 0), '1' Meaning that the passanger survived and '0' that not.\n\n**Pclass**: Ticket class (1, 2, 3), each one considered as first, second, or third class.\n\n**Name**: Name of the passanger (String)\n\n**sex**: Biological sex (male, female)\n\n**Age**: Age in years (Positive float)\n\n**SibSp**: # of siblings or spouses aboard the Titanic (Positive integer)\n    \n**Parch**: # of parents or children aboard the Titanic (Positive integer)\n\n**Ticket**: Ticket number (String)\n    \n**fare**: Ticket fare (Positive float)\n\n**cabin**: Cabin number (String)\n    \n**embarked**: Port of Embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Based on the information provided, we have determined the data types associated with each column.

We will identify the five nearest neighbors for each missing value and assign the missing value as the mean of the 'Age' values of its nearest neighbors.\n        * Regarding the 'Cabin' attribute, we will simplify the approach by converting it into a binary variable. We will assign '1' to instances with a valid 'Cabin' value and '0' to instances with missing cabin values.\n        * As for the 'Embarked' attribute, since there are only two instances with missing values, we will simply remove those instances from the dataset.\n    * ***Dropping unused attributes***: We will drop certain attributes from the dataset as they either serve as index values or are too complex to conduct further analysis. The attributes 'PassengerId', 'Name', and 'Ticket' will be removed from the dataset.\n    \n    \n* **Data Transformation**:\n    * ***Feature Scaling***: To ensure that the numerical attributes have the same scale, we will perform feature scaling using the MinMaxScaler transformation. This technique will be applied to the attributes 'Pclass', 'Age', 'SibSp', 'Parch', and 'Fare'. The MinMaxScaler will normalize the values of these attributes between 0 and 1. This will prevent any particular attribute from dominating the analysis due to a larger scale.\n    * ***Encoding Categorical Variables***: Categorical variables need to be encoded into numerical form to be used in machine learning algorithms.\n        * For the 'Sex' and 'Cabin' attributes, which have binary values, we will assign '1' and '0' for their categories.\n        * For the 'Embarked' attribute, which has three possible values (C, Q, S), we will use one-hot encoding. This means creating three separate binary variables, where each variable represents one possible value.
